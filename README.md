# 3D Solar System Simulation

This is a simple interactive 3D simulation of the Solar System built using Three.js.  
It includes all 8 planets orbiting the Sun with features like speed control, hover tooltips, pause/resume, and click-to-zoom. The entire project is mobile responsive and works directly in the browser.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the folder.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (no setup required).
3. Interact with the system using your mouse or touch.

## Features Implemented

- Sun + 8 Planets: Each has its own size, color, distance, and speed.
- Orbit Rings: Circular orbit paths for each planet.
- 3D Animation: Planets orbit the Sun in real-time.
- Speed Sliders: Adjust individual planet speeds.
- Pause/Resume Button: Temporarily freeze the simulation.
- Hover Tooltips: Show planet name on hover.
- Click-to-Zoom: Click a planet to zoom in, click empty space to zoom out.
